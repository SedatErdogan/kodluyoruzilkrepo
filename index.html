    Computer Programming. In 2017, I transferred to the
    computer engineering department of Karabuk
    University with Vertical Transfer Exam and graduated
    from here in 2022. Throughout my education life, i
    made small projects using Html, Css and JavaScript.
    During my internship, i tested different screens using
    cucumber, selenium and nightwatch.js and improved
    myself in the testing area. In my senior project, i
    designed a chatbot using natural language processing
    with PyTorch.
